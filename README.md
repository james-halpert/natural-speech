There is an issue with common words in the dictionary after 813 common words are generated (uncommon words are appended in alphabetical order), use caution when generating larger dictionaries.

1. Generate a dictionary or use the included dictionary.csv
2. Use the trainer.py to import the dictionary file
3. Click "next word" to begin recording one word at a time (1 sec audio recordings)
4. Once a collection of words has been generated in your "words" directory, use the mywords.py program to convert your text to spoken audio.
